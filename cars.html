          <h3>
            The Dodge Challenger has now been kicking around without a complete
            redesign for a decade, yet it actually seems to be getting more
            popular in its old age. Credit a substantial overhaul a few years
            ago, constant tinkering, and a yearly roll out of exciting new
            variants. For the 2019 Dodge Challenger, we welcome the
            797-horsepower Hellcat Redeye and R/T Scat Pack Widebody.
          </h3>
          <p>
            However, there's an inherent honesty and unique goodness to the
            Challenger that allows it to still duke it out with the Ford Mustang
            and Chevy Camaro â€“ despite those age-old rivals' transformation into
            something more akin to a sports car. The Challenger, by contrast, is
            100% muscle car more concerned with straight-line performance than
            handling precision. It's also much bigger and practical, lending
            itself better to daily driver duty. That, plus its distinctive style
            and diverse model lineup, make it easy to see why the Challenger
            continues to enjoy such massive success. You can certainly count us
            among its fans.
          </p>
          <p>
            The regular Hellcat gets a 10-hp bump as well as a new "dual
            snorkel" hood. Further down the Challenger pecking order, you can
            now get all-wheel drive on the base SXT. What's the interior and
            in-car technology like? The Challenger's interior certainly isn't as
            characterful and flamboyant as its exterior would suggest. The
            Mustang and Camaro are more interesting and distinctive inside.
            Still, there are some interesting design flourishes that spruce
            things up, from the base trim's standard houndstooth cloth to the
            two-tone leather choices available as options. Besides, we're not
            sure how flamboyant you need the interior to be in a car available
            in electric orange, blue, green and purple paint colors.
          </p>
          <p>
            Furthermore, what the Challenger interior may lack in visual
            pizzazz, it makes up for with space (see below) and technology. A
            7-inch touchscreen is standard, but all trim levels have an 8.4-inch
            version available as an option or standard. Both are among the
            easiest to use in the industry, and we prefer the 8.4-inch unit in
            particular to what's offered by the Camaro and Mustang. Heck, the
            Ford doesn't even come standard with a touchscreen, let alone the
            Apple CarPlay and Android Auto that are included on every
            Challenger.
          </p>
          <p>
            How big is it? For a performance coupe, the Challenger is enormous.
            It's nearly 9 inches longer than a Camaro or Mustang; 3 or 4 inches
            taller, respectively; and its wheelbase is 6 or 9 inches longer. The
            most basic Challenger SXT weighs 400 pounds more than a V6 Camaro.
            While that size is definitely a detriment to the Challenger's
            handling and straight-line performance, it's a boon for interior
            space and everyday functionality.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are so many models and options available on the 2019 Dodge
            Challenger that this section would start to resemble an order sheet
            if we tried to list it all. Luckily, we provide a pretty clean
            breakdown here on Autoblog featuring each model's features, specs
            and local pricing. In brief, though, every Challenger comes standard
            with proximity entry and push-button start, dual-zone automatic
            climate control, a power driver seat, a leather-wrapped steering
            wheel, 60/40-split back seat, two USB ports, a 7-inch Uconnect
            touchscreen, Apple CarPlay, Android Auto and a six-speaker sound
            system.
